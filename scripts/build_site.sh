# build_site.sh -- assemble the full GitHub Pages site from the packed libs,
# INCREMENTALLY: only libs whose content changed since the last PUBLISHED
# state are repacked (file_packager over the full ~2.4GB of trees takes a
# while; a one-lib change must not repack all ~90).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_site.sh <release_dir> <driver_tag> <cache_dir> <site_dir>
#
#   <release_dir>  extracted fluffos-<ver>-wasm.zip (fluffos.js/.wasm,
#                  index.html, telnet.js, vendor/)
#   <driver_tag>   the release tag those files came from (cache key part)
#   <cache_dir>    persistent dir (actions/cache) holding packed/<slug>/
#                  bundles + manifest.json from previous runs
#   <site_dir>     output dir for the assembled site (recreated every run)
#
# Environment:
#   LAST_PUBLISHED_SHA  (optional) commit sha of the tree the LIVE site was
#                  last successfully deployed from (CI reads it off the
#                  pages-state branch -- see .github/workflows/pages.yml).
#                  The commit and its trees must be resolvable in this
#                  clone (CI does a --filter=blob:none fetch of it; tree
#                  hashes need no blobs).  Empty/unset/unresolvable ->
#                  every lib counts as changed (full repack).
#
# Incremental model -- two mechanisms with distinct roles:
#
#   CORRECTNESS (what must be freshly packed) is anchored on the durable
#   LAST_PUBLISHED_SHA marker: a lib counts as changed iff
#   `git rev-parse $LAST_PUBLISHED_SHA:libs/<slug>` differs from
#   `git rev-parse HEAD:libs/<slug>` (or the base is unknown).  Because the
#   marker is only advanced after a deploy actually succeeds, a surviving
#   run always repacks the full cumulative set of libs touched since the
#   live site's real state -- no matter how many intermediate runs were
#   cancelled (cancel-in-progress) and left nothing behind.
#
#   SPEED (skipping the pack of an unchanged lib) additionally requires the
#   actions/cache to hold a bundle whose recorded provenance matches the
#   CURRENT inputs: cache_dir/manifest.json records
#   {driver_tag, packer, libs: {slug: tree}} for the bundles in the cache,
#   where tree = the slug's tree hash at pack time and packer = the git
#   blob sha fingerprint of pack_lib_for_web.sh (+ optional web-shell
#   override page).  A cached bundle is reused iff the lib is unchanged
#   since last publish AND the manifest says the bundle was packed from
#   exactly HEAD's tree with the current driver tag and packer.  A driver
#   release bump or packer edit invalidates every bundle (they embed
#   driver-coupled page glue).  The cache/manifest is thus a pure
#   optimization: evicted, stale, or missing just means slower (up to one
#   full repack), never wrong -- the marker alone decides what MUST be
#   repacked.  Bundles for slugs that no longer exist (or turned noboot)
#   are pruned.
#
# The cache dir also carries lib-commits.json -- slug -> the last commit
# that actually changed libs/<slug> (shown on the index cards), maintained
# by scripts/update_lib_commits.py via the GitHub commits API because the
# shallow CI clone has no usable history.  Same durable-anchor/disposable-
# cache split as above: entries self-validate against the slug's current
# tree hash, so a lost or evicted cache only costs API re-queries, never
# wrong data (see that script's header for the full model).
#
# Outputs (for CI): appends "repacked=<n>", "changed=<n>" and
# "repacked_slugs=<space-separated slugs>" to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set
# (changed = repacked + pruned, i.e. whether the cache is worth re-saving;
# a lib-commits.json refresh alone deliberately does NOT count -- re-saving
# the ~2GB cache to persist a ~10KB mapping costs more than the API
# re-queries it would save.  repacked_slugs is currently unconsumed by the
# workflow -- there used to be a boot smoke test keyed off it, removed
# because it kept failing CI on slow-under-node-timeout boots that don't
# reflect the real browser deploy; left here in case a future, less timing-
# sensitive check wants it).
