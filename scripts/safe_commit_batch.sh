#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Merge-queue guard for the parallel WASM-enablement/verification/bring-up
# batches. All batch agents share ONE working tree (no per-agent worktrees),
# so several of them can have unstaged edits sitting in libs/<slug>/ at the
# same time. Before committing any one batch's work, this script stages
# ONLY that batch's own lib paths and refuses to proceed if anything else
# ends up staged -- e.g. because a batch's assigned lib list was wrong, or
# because `git add` was given a glob that reached outside it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/safe_commit_batch.sh [--dry-run] <slug1> [slug2 ...] -- <commit message file>
#
# --dry-run: stage and validate as normal, print what WOULD be committed,
# then unstage and exit 0 without committing or pushing. Use this to check
# a batch's isolation before it's actually ready to land.
#
# Behavior:
#   1. `git reset` (unstage everything -- start from a clean index so a
#      leftover stage from a previous run/batch can't ride along).
#   2. `git add libs/<slug>/` for each slug given (only these paths, plus
#      any extra paths listed after a literal `+` argument, e.g. shared
#      README.md/AGENTS.md edits belonging to this same batch).
#   3. Verify every staged path falls under one of the allowed prefixes.
#      Any violation aborts: unstages everything and exits 1 WITHOUT
#      committing, printing the offending paths so the orchestrator can
#      investigate (most likely cause: another batch's in-flight edit to
#      a lib that should have been exclusive to it).
#   4. Commit with the message file, then `git push origin main`.
#
# This is a safety guard, not a lock -- it does not stop a second batch
# from writing to disk concurrently. It only stops the ORCHESTRATOR from
# accidentally sweeping a concurrent batch's unfinished edits into a
# commit meant for a different batch. Only the orchestrator (not batch
# agents themselves) runs this script; batch agents are read-only w.r.t.
# git by standing policy.
